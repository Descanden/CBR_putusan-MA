# Case-Based Reasoning on Civil Court Decisions (PMH)
An end-to-end pipeline for building a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) system using Supreme Court decisions in civil law—specifically *Perbuatan Melawan Hukum* (Unlawful Acts), comparing the performance of **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** and **TF-IDF + SVM** approaches.

## Overview

This project implements a *Case-Based Reasoning* system to support legal analysis and recommendation based on previous court cases. The pipeline includes five main stages: document scraping, information extraction, case representation, case retrieval, and solution evaluation — **all integrated into a single notebook file**: `casebase_build.ipynb`.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Descanden/CBR_putusan-MA.git
cd CBR_putusan-MA
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# If PowerShell policy error:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# For macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is still empty, you can generate it automatically:
```bash
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs . --force
```

## Running the Pipeline

All stages of the project are executed within the notebook file: `casebase_build.ipynb`.

### 📘 Pipeline Stages:
1. **Stage 1 – Case Base Construction**
   - Read PDF files from `PMH_PDF/`
   - Extract and clean text content
   - Save cleaned text to `data/raw/`
   - Write logs to `logs/cleaning.log`

2. **Stage 2 – Case Representation**
   - Extract metadata: case number, date, parties, legal articles
   - Generate case fact summaries
   - Build features: text length, Bag-of-Words, QA-pairs

3. **Stage 3 – Case Retrieval**
   - Convert text into TF-IDF vectors
   - Build retrieval models:
     - TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
     - TF-IDF + SVM classifier

4. **Stage 4 – Solution Reuse**
   - Retrieve the most similar past case
   - Reuse the previous court verdict as prediction

5. **Stage 5 – Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model predictions using:
     - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Save evaluation outputs to `data/eval/`

### 🔧 Run via:
```bash
jupyter notebook casebase_build.ipynb
```
